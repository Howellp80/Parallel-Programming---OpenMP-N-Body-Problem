Using OpenMP, this project involves a rumble between static scheduling vs. dynamic, and coarse-grained parallelism
vs. fine-grained.
The problem that we are solving is an "N-Body Problem", in which a group of planetary masses are
swarming around by being mutually attracted to each other.

Within proj2.cpp, lines 59-62 and 81, 82, 92, and 93 are used to access the desired test. (Could probably be cleaned up...)
To run:
copy these files to your directory 
modify the lines mentioned above to run the desired test
execute the program:  $ python script.py
